Overview
This project implements a dynamic pricing system using machine learning techniques to optimize pricing strategies based on customer behavior and market trends. The goal is to analyze historical sales and customer data to predict optimal pricing for products or services to maximize revenue and profitability.

Project Description
The dynamic pricing system leverages machine learning models to predict optimal prices for products or services. The project includes:

Data Collection: Gathering historical sales and customer data.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating features that influence pricing decisions.
Model Training: Training various machine learning models to predict optimal prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and accuracy.
Implementation: Deploying the model to adjust pricing dynamically based on real-time data.
Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes:

Product_ID: Unique identifier for each product or service
Date: Date of the transaction
Sales: Number of units sold
Price: Price of the product or service
Customer_Demographics: Information about the customer (e.g., age, location)
Market_Conditions: External factors affecting pricing (e.g., seasonality, competition)
Historical_Pricing: Historical pricing data for trend analysis

Results
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for model training.
Feature Engineering: Developed features that significantly impact pricing decisions.
Model Training: Implemented and trained machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Implementation: Deployed the model to adjust prices dynamically, resulting in optimized pricing strategies and increased revenue.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn
